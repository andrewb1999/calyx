# Debugging Tips
Debugging Calyx programs that run to completion and generate the wrong value
can be challenging.
We can first try to eliminate some common causes of problems.

## Disabling Optimizations

The first step is disabling optimization passes.
The Calyx compiler refers to bundles of optimizations using two *aliases*:
`pre-opt` and `post-opt`.
`pre-opt` passes run before the main compilation passes that remove the control
program while `post-opt` passes run after.

To disable the passes, add the flag `-d pre-opt -d post-opt` to compiler invocation:
1. For the compiler: `futil <filename> -d pre-opt -d post-opt`.
2. For `fud`: `fud ... -s futil.flags "-d pre-opt -d post-opt"`.

If the execution generates the right result, then one of the optimizations
passes is incorrect.
To identify which optimization pass is wrong, add back individual passes and see
when the execution fails.
To do so, first run `futil --list-passes` to see the names of the passes that make
up the `pre-opt` and `post-opt` aliases.
Next, re-enable each pass by doing: `-d pre-opt -d post-opt -p <pass1> -p
<pass2>` and so on.

## Disabling Static Timing

`tdst` is one of the two control compilation passes.
It uses the latency information on groups to generate faster hardware but may be cause of buggy compilation. Disable it using the flag `-d tdst`.

## Reducing Test Files

It is often possible to reduce the size of the example program that is
generating incorrect results.
In order to perform a reduction, we need to run the program twice, once with
a "golden workflow" that we trust to generate the right result and once with
the buggy workflow.

For example, if we've identified the problem to be in one of the Calyx passes,
the "golden workflow" is running the program without the pass while the buggy
workflow is running the program with the pass enabled.
This case is so common that we've written [a script][flag-cmp] that can run
programs with different set of flags to the Calyx compiler and show the
difference in the outputs after simulation.

The script is invoked as:
```
tools/flag-compare.sh <calyx program> <data>
```

By default, the script will try to run the programs by simulating them through
Verilator by providing `fud` with the target `--to dat`.
If you'd like to use the Calyx Interpreter instead, run the following command:
```
tools/flag-compare.sh <calyx program> <data> interpreter-out
```

### Reducing Calyx Programs

The best way to reduce Calyx program deleting group enables from the control
program and seeing if the generated program still generates the wrong output.
While doing this, make sure that you're not deleting an update to a loop
variable which might cause infinite loops.

By default, the compiler will complain if the program contains a `group` that
is not used in the control program which can get in the way of minimizing
programs.
To get around this, run the [`dead-group-removal`][dgr] pass before the validation
passes:
```
futil -p dead-group-removal -p validate ...
```

### Reducing Dahlia Programs

If you're working with Dahlia programs, it is also possible to reduce the
program with the script since it simply uses `fud` to run the program with the
simulator.
As with Calyx reduction, try deleting parts of the program and seeing if the
flag configurations for the Calyx program still generate different outputs.


## Waveform Debugging

Waveform debugging is the final way of debugging Calyx programs.
A waveform captures the value of every port at every clock cycle and can be
viewed using a wave viewer program like [GTKWave][gtkwave] or
[WaveTrace][wavetrace] to look at the wave form.
Because of this level of granularity, it generates a lot of information.
To make the information a little more digestible, we can use information
generated by Calyx during compilation.

For waveform debugging, we recommend disabling the optimization passes and
static timing compilation (unless you're debugging these passes).
In this debugging strategy, we'll do the following:
1. Dump out the control FSM for the program we're debugging.
2. Find the FSM states that enable the particular groups that might be misbehaving.
3. Open the waveform viewer and find clock cycles where the FSM takes the corresponding
values and identify other signals that we care about.

Consider the control section from [examples/futil/dot-product.futil](https://github.com/cucapra/calyx/blob/master/examples/futil/dot-product.futil):
```
{{#include ../../examples/futil/dot-product.futil:control}}
```
Suppose that we want to make sure that `let0` is correctly performing its
computation.
We can generate the control FSM for the program using:

      futil <filename> -p validate -p remove-comb-groups -p tdcc -x tdcc:dump-fsm -b none

The `-x tdcc:dump-fsm` is a special flag that tells the `tdcc` flag to print out
the FSM for the control program. The `-b none` suppress printing of the lowered Calyx program:
```
======== main:tdcc =========
0:
  let0[go] = !let0[done] ? 1'd1;
1:
  cond00[go] = !cond00[done] ? 1'd1;
2:
  par[go] = !par[done] ? 1'd1;
3:
  let1[go] = !let1[done] ? 1'd1;
4:
  let2[go] = !let2[done] ? 1'd1;
5:
  upd2[go] = !upd2[done] ? 1'd1;
6:
  upd3[go] = !upd3[done] ? 1'd1;
7:
  cond00[go] = !cond00[done] ? 1'd1;
8:
  <end>
transitions:
  (0, 1): let0[done]
  (1, 2): cond00[done] & comb_reg.out
  (1, 8): cond00[done] & !comb_reg.out
  (2, 3): par[done]
  (3, 4): let1[done]
  (4, 5): let2[done]
  (5, 6): upd2[done]
  (6, 7): upd3[done]
  (7, 2): cond00[done] & comb_reg.out
  (7, 8): cond00[done] & !comb_reg.out
```

The assignments to `let0[go]` indicate what conditions make the `let0` group
execute.
We can see that in this program, `let0[go]` is activated in FSM state `0`.
```
0:
  let0[go] = !let0[done] ? 1'd1;
```

Additionally, the `transitions` section shows us that when `let0[done]` is `1`, the FSM is going to transition to state `1`.
```
transitions:
  (0, 1): let0[done]
```

Once we have this information, we can open the VCD file and look at points when
the `fsm` register has the value 1 and check to see if the assignments in
`let0` activated in the way we expected.
